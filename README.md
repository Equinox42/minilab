## Goals

This repository has several purposes. First, it acts as a showcase of the technologies and practices I’m currently experimenting with, learning, and deploying in my homelab. 

It also serves as a structured place to document what I build and how I build it — a complement to my Obsidian vault, but in a format I can easily share and reference publicly. Ultimately, this repo is both a learning space and a long-term knowledge base for my tooling
